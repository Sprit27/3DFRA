# 3DFRA
3D Face Recognition for Attendance System (Final Year Project):
* Technologies: Python, Flask, OpenCV, face_recognition library, HTML/CSS.<br>
* Engineered and implemented a real-time 3D Face Recognition attendance system, serving as the final year capstone project.<br>
* Utilized OpenCV for camera control, stream handling, and color calibration.<br>
* Implemented the face_recognition library to generate and store face encodings during registration and match them against live video feeds for accurate, real-time attendance logging.<br>
* Developed a user-friendly application interface using Flask and associated HTML/CSS templates.<br>

<h2>This is a face recognition software which could be used to detect and store attendance of students and employes.</h2>

Instructions:
1. First download the SQLite studio for database.
2. Then download the necessory libraries.
3. In order to download the face_recognition library, you will first need to download the dlib library.
4. If your installitation faces problem to create whl for dlib, download the above provided wil(for python 10), and install it first. If you have any other version of python, search for your version of whl here (https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x). After downloading  the whl localy do the normal pip install
   ```shell
        $ pip install dlib-19.22.99-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
6. if the face_recognition_models do not work , you will need to install the setuptools.
   ```shell
          $ pip install setuptools


It is a Flask app which used Machine learning and computer vision libraries (OpenCV, face_recognition, numpy, pilow).
